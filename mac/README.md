## [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/)

This uses a lua script to do some complex functions, rather than just mapping keys to other keys

* Makes caps lock the 'hyper' key (f17), which is used by karabiner
* pressing just caps lock presses escape
* caps + q -> sleep
* cmd+ctrl+option with left, right, up will snap windows

## [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

This is declarative and operates at a lower level, so these are faster than hammerspoon bindings. This controls all the other bindings, like arrows keys and tab scrolling
