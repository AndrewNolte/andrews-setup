## [Kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad)
This is the most recent iteration of my keybindings. It's adapted from my linux keybindings, as I realized kmonad worked cross platform (no more Karabiner) It has everything in the other bindings, plus much more, and you're able to edit/understand them much more easily due to the nice declarative nature of the language. (Karabiner is super verbose json). The downside is setup is not as clean, but I attempted to make decent install/startup scripts for mac. For the explanation check out [mac/kmonad/kmonad.kbd](kmonad/kmonad.kbd)

## [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

Older iteration of keybindings, not able to reach the level of the kmonad bindings due to the hyper-key implementation.

## [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

This is used for window management, i.e. snapping windows to split screen
